				Welcome to my website! This page will go over 3 reasons why Vue
				is better than React.
			</h2>
			<section id="easy" class="reason">
				<h3>Reason 1: Vue is easier to learn</h3>
				<p>
					Vue is easier to learn than React. It has a smaller API and
					is less opinionated. This makes it easier to get started
					with Vue and to build a project with it.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="flex" class="reason">
				<h3>Reason 2: Vue is more flexible</h3>
				<p>
					Vue is more flexible than React. It allows you to use
					templates, JSX, or render functions. This makes it easier to
					integrate Vue into an existing project or to use it with
					other libraries.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="docs" class="reason">
				<h3>Reason 3: Vue has better documentation</h3>
				<p>
					Vue has better documentation than React. It is more
					comprehensive and easier to understand. This makes it easier
					to learn Vue and to find answers to your questions.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="outro">
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Vue is better than React because it is easier to learn, more
					flexible, and has better documentation. If you are new to
					front-end development or are looking for a new library to
					use, I recommend giving Vue a try.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="bonus" class="reason">
				<h3>Bonus Reason: Vue has better state management</h3>
				<p>
					Vue has better state management than React. It has a
					built-in reactivity system and a more intuitive way to
					manage state. This makes it easier to build complex
					applications with Vue.
				</p>
				<h4>Pinia vs Redux</h4>
				<p>
					Pinia is a state management library for Vue that is easier
					to use than Redux. It is more intuitive and has better
					performance. This makes it easier to manage state in a Vue
					application.
